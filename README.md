# Cognitive-Robotics-Deep-Learning-for-your-Face-Detection-in-Rpi

# 🖼️ Auto Face Detection & Recognition  

This project uses **OpenCV + LBPH Face Recognizer** to:  
1️⃣ Capture your face automatically (30 images)  
2️⃣ Train a model on-the-fly  
3️⃣ Start **real-time recognition** immediately  

If your face is recognized, a **green box with confidence score** appears.  
If not, a **red box** labeled **"Unknown"** is shown.  

Designed to work on **Raspberry Pi 5** or any computer with Python 3.
